# 💰 SalaryPreds

**SalaryPreds** is an AI-powered web application that predicts whether a person earns more than $50,000 per year based on U.S. Census data. Built with a focus on **explainability**, the app not only makes predictions but also **visualizes the top features driving the decision using SHAP**.

> Developed solo by [Kanif Kumbhar](https://github.com/Kanif-Kumbhar) as a demonstration of full-stack ML deployment with Streamlit and XGBoost.

## 🚀 Live Demo

Coming soon...  
(You can run it locally using the instructions below 👇)

---

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Predict income class (`<=50K` or `>50K`) using trained ML model
- ✅ Built-in preprocessing using pipelines (OneHot, StandardScaler, etc.)
- ✅ SHAP waterfall plot for individual prediction explanation
- ✅ Feature importance bar chart
- ✅ Responsive Streamlit UI with tooltips
- ✅ Fully open-source, reproducible ML workflow

## 📊 Model Evaluation

The model was trained and validated on the [UCI Adult Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult). Several models were evaluated before finalizing `XGBoost`.

### 📌 Confusion Matrix (XGBoost)

### 📈 Shap Force Plot

### 📊 Shap Summary

> All visualizations were generated using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `shap`.

## 🧠 SHAP Explanation

To ensure transparency, predictions are accompanied by **SHAP waterfall plots** explaining how each input feature influenced the decision.
